<h3>Soccer</h3>
	<p>Junior Year, runner up in the Class 2 State Final </br>
	I am a team captain for the St Charles West Boys soccer team.
	My experience in soccer and being a leader on the team has made me grow 
	as a person and a leader. As a team, we had to communicate with 
	one another and our success was based on our communication. 
	While I also have a responsibility of galvanizing my teammates durring 
	practices or games.</p>
<h3>Tennis</h3>
	<p>Another sport I partake in is Tennis. Being a first timer to Tennis, I have learned how
	to adapt to new experiences and how to take feedback from others. </p>
<h3>Student Council</h3>
	<p>I have been an avid member of Student Council throughout high school.
	I have shown my leadership abilities while being elected as the 
	Junior Class President. As I have successfully organized class meetings for 
	dances and school assemblies. While I also have had to communicate and 
	solve problems as my time as an officer.</p>
<h3>Skills USA Member</h3>
	<p>I will be competing in Skills USA, in the prepared speech contest.</p>
<h3>Bloodrive Donation</h3>
	<p>I donated blood to the Mississippi Valley Regional Blood Center</p>
<h3>Can Food Drives-High School and KickHunger</h3>
	<p>I always participate in my school's can food drives and this year I brought in 
	items for the CSD class KickHunger campaign also. As I believe that especially
	during times that we should spend with our families, those who are in need
	should be extended a helping hand.</p>
